Just a basic introduction to DOM manipulation for first year students. Keep in mind that style was not the focus here, so we kept css to a bare minimum. Feel free to stylize them however you want. 

One important note : I actually do not recommend innerHTML, look into youtube why it can be quite dangerous.
